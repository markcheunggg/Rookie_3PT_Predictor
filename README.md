## by Mark Cheung

This code uses a Random Forests model to predict an NBA player's increase in 3P% from their rookie season to their second season using their draft age,
draft position, and college/rookie season shooting stats. It also lists previous NBA players who have had
similar college and rookie shooting numbers to that player using k-means clustering.
